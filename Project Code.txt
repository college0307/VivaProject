                    A front-end developer uses code that affects how a website looks and how a user interacts with its webpages. That includes simple elements such as buttons that take a visitor to different places within the website, as well as input methods, like a contact form. The programming languages that a front-end developer uses can create a static webpage or a dynamic one</p>

                    The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                </p>
                <p><b>HTML Elements<b>
				<p>
				   HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

                    <b>Selectors </b><br><br>
  
                   Selectors in CSS I
                    CSS selectors are implemented for selecting the substance of your web page you wish to style. These selectors act as the components of the rule set of CSS. CSS selectors choose elements in HTML based on the class, id, attribute, type, etc.

Selectors are those names that you give to your different styles.
In the definition of style, you define how each selector should work (size, color, etc.).
Then, in HTML pages, you mention these selectors to implement styles.
There are few basic types of selectors in the CSS from the initial version, and various upcoming versions of CSS have introduced many other selectors. Some of them are:

CSS id Selector
CSS class Selector
CSS Element Selector
CSS Group Selector
By applying all the above selectors, you will find that you can apply the same or different style to all HTML elements and tune them by adding ID, class, or by adding selectors for specific elements.</P>

                    JavaScript  often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.[11] As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[12] often incorporating third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model </p>

                  Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers.

<dl style ="color:Indigo">				 
<dt>Pre-Defined Features</dt>
<dd>Bootstrap is well known for delivering pre-defined elements and features. The framework supplies a div-based architecture, and developers need not write the code from scratch.</dd>

<dt>Easy Customization</dt>
<dd>
Bootstrap presents and enables default properties, such as color, border, margin, padding, etc., which are effortlessly customizable, as per business requirements. The developer can overwrite the code of the property as required.
</dd>

<dt>Ideal for Responsive Design</dt>
<dd>With a non-complex div-based structure, Bootstrap is an ideal solution for developing responsive design websites.
The framework proposes pre-defined CSS classes to construct a responsive web page.</dd>


<dt>Widely Used and In Demand </dt>
<dd>
Several organizations, start-ups and big scale industries, have the best preferences for Bootstrap or comparable frameworks for their UI design requirements. Once developers become knowledgeable and understand this subject, they can more easily grasp custom-made frameworks utilized by several organizations. Hence, it provides the best UI development experience for the UI developers for their professions.

                   ReactJS tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of ReactJS. Currently, ReactJS is one of the most popular JavaScript front-end libraries which has a strong foundation and a large community.

ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building reusable UI components. It is an open-source, component-based front end library which is responsible only for the view layer of the application. It was initially developed and maintained by Facebook and later used in its products like WhatsApp & Instagram.

                    ReactJS Components
					 <h3>Function Components</h3>
					 In React, function components are a way to write components that only contain a render method and don't have their own state. They are simply JavaScript functions that may or may not receive data as parameters. We can create a function that takes props(properties) as input and returns what should be rendered.
